[TREE_OF_WISDOM_1]
Thank you for feeding me! Keep giving me food and I'll give you valuable information!

[TREE_OF_WISDOM_2]
Chompers and wall-nuts work exceedingly well together. It's no surprise, considering they were roommates in college.

[TREE_OF_WISDOM_3]
If you ever listen to anything I say, listen to this: you want two columns of sunflowers. I'm dead serious here.

[TREE_OF_WISDOM_4]
Snorkel zombies. I hate 'em. How do I deal? Wall-nuts on lily pads, that's how.

[TREE_OF_WISDOM_5]
Pssst! Try typing 'future' while playing to experience zombies... from the FUTURE!

[TREE_OF_WISDOM_6]
How many cherry bombs does it take to take down a Gargantuar? Here's a hint: more than one, fewer than three. Here's a more explicit hint: Two.

[TREE_OF_WISDOM_7]
If you're looking for mushroom plants for your Zen Garden, you'll have better luck playing on levels where it's nighttime.

[TREE_OF_WISDOM_8]
I wouldn't worry about permanently damaging your lawn with doom-shrooms. In time the earth heals itself.

[TREE_OF_WISDOM_9]
Have you tried clicking on the flowers on the main menu? Give it a shot! I'll wait here.

[TREE_OF_WISDOM_10]
Legend has it that frozen zombies eat slower. I'm here to tell that legend has its facts straight.

[TREE_OF_WISDOM_11]
Have you heard of the elusive Yeti Zombie? Some say he likes hiding where it's pitch black.

[TREE_OF_WISDOM_12]
What's cheaper than free? Nothing! That's why puff-shrooms are essential on all night levels! 

[TREE_OF_WISDOM_13]
Are you hoping to find water plants for your Zen Garden? I bet my phloem you'll have the most luck searching in pool levels.

[TREE_OF_WISDOM_14]
Have you noticed that Gargantuars sometimes use OTHER ZOMBIES to bash your plants? Whatever works, I guess.

[TREE_OF_WISDOM_15]
Stinky the Snail sure loves his chocolate. Maybe loves it a little too much, you know? He won't sit still for an hour after he's had some.

[TREE_OF_WISDOM_16]
If you think playing survival 'endless' mode only drops pool-style plants for your Zen Garden, think again! It drops everything-style.

[TREE_OF_WISDOM_17]
Often the question is asked: where do you find chocolate? A better question would be: where DON'T you find chocolate? It drops in every game mode!

[TREE_OF_WISDOM_18]
Grave Busters, eh? Pick 'em only when you can see graves on the right side of the screen along with the zombies. That's what I do.

[TREE_OF_WISDOM_19]
I've heard that Buckethead zombies take five times as many hits as regular ones.

[TREE_OF_WISDOM_20]
I hear that typing 'mustache' brings about a terrifying transformation in the undead!

[TREE_OF_WISDOM_21]
Do multiple Snow-peas in a row slow zombies down more than just one? The sad but truthful answer is 'Nay.'

[TREE_OF_WISDOM_22]
You know that zombies emerge from gravestones, right? So what's stopping you from using grave busters to get rid of them in Survival night? Is it pride?

[TREE_OF_WISDOM_23]
If you're looking for the inside info on how long a level's going to be, count the flags on the level meter. That'll set you up real nice.

[TREE_OF_WISDOM_24]
Roof cleaners. Classic items. Can't recommend them highly enough. Best thing about them? They give you a shot at beating Pogo Party.

[TREE_OF_WISDOM_25]
If you're wondering if feeding a hypno-shroom to a dancer zombie compels him to summon backup dancers for you, bet it all on 'Yes.'

[TREE_OF_WISDOM_26]
Make Money Fast! By Playing Survival Endless! Then E-mail Me Your Bank Account Number!

[TREE_OF_WISDOM_27]
You'd think torchwoods would douse snow peas. And you'd be correct, because you, my friend, are one smart cookie.

[TREE_OF_WISDOM_28]
Those hateful ZomBotany zombies! Who do they think they are, shooting at your plants? It's a good thing wall-nuts stop 'em cold.

[TREE_OF_WISDOM_29]
The Pogo Party and Bobsled Bonanza mini-games are really, really, really difficult. Wanna drop one of the 'reallys' off that description? Use the squash.

[TREE_OF_WISDOM_30]
Just when you thought jalapenos couldn't be any more useful, a Tree of Wisdom lets you know that they also destroy the Zomboni's ice trails! BAM!

[TREE_OF_WISDOM_31]
Once you buy the imitater, try clicking the little drawing in the upper left corner of your Almanac to access the entry on that sucker.

[TREE_OF_WISDOM_32]
The number of coins you receive in Wall-nut Bowling is proportional to how cool you are as measured by how many ricochets per nut you can pull off.

[TREE_OF_WISDOM_33]
Please do not tap on the glass! Or actually, go ahead; right-click on your Aquarium Garden or during Zombiquarium to deafen your underwater creatures.

[TREE_OF_WISDOM_34]
When I was just an acorn my grampa told me, 'Son, Vasebreaker puzzles are much easier if you break the vases on the right side first.' 

[TREE_OF_WISDOM_35]
Dancers in I, Zombie may seem expensive, but in the right situation they're worth every penny.

[TREE_OF_WISDOM_36]
I had a dream. In it, cattail spikes popped balloons and dropped zombies to the ground. I don't know what it means.

[TREE_OF_WISDOM_37]
Growing aquatic plants in your Zen Garden is pretty much impossible without the Aquarium Garden. Just saying.

[TREE_OF_WISDOM_38]
Digger zombies violate the natural order with their subterranean ways. It's only fair to use magnet-shrooms to steal their mining picks.

[TREE_OF_WISDOM_39]
Every day brings new challenges and opportunities. Oh, and new marigolds in Crazy Dave's shop.

[TREE_OF_WISDOM_40]
Mushroom Garden! Huh! What is it good for? Absolutely nothin'! Except growing mushrooms, that is.

[TREE_OF_WISDOM_41]
Tired? Depressed? Ladders on tall-nuts getting you down? A quick magnet-shroom will whisk your cares away!

[TREE_OF_WISDOM_42]
The tallness of tall-nuts earns widespread acclaim due to their effectiveness vs. Dolphin Riders and Pogo Zombies.

[TREE_OF_WISDOM_43]
The explosive force of a cherry bomb or jalapeno is more than capable of dislodging a ladder from a Wall-nut.

[TREE_OF_WISDOM_44]
It's tempting to feed all your chocolate to Stinky the Snail. He's such a chocolate hog. But remember: Zen Garden plants like chocolate too!

[TREE_OF_WISDOM_45]
Torchwood fire is hotter than rage, but Zombonis, screen doors, ladders and catapults can take the heat.

[TREE_OF_WISDOM_46]
If you rely on upgrade plants in Survival: Endless, be acutely aware that they get more expensive the more you have on your lawn.

[TREE_OF_WISDOM_47]
The Imps in I, Zombie seem weak. But they're speedy and great for fetching that last brain when you've cleared the rest of the opposition.

[TREE_OF_WISDOM_48]
If you type 'trickedout,' don't be surprised if you see something wacky happen to your lawnmowers.

[TREE_OF_WISDOM_49]
Thank you for feeding me! I'm out of new wisdom for now, but I might have more if you grow me tall enough!

[TREE_OF_WISDOM_101]
Mmmm, I could sure use some yummy fertilizer!

[TREE_OF_WISDOM_102]
I think I've seen that cloud before.

[TREE_OF_WISDOM_103]
Don't mind me. I'll just be over here, growing.

[TREE_OF_WISDOM_104]
I'm metabolizing like crazy!

[TREE_OF_WISDOM_105]
I'll never get why you animals spend all day moving around like you do.

[TREE_OF_WISDOM_106]
I experience time at a vastly slower rate than you!

[TREE_OF_WISDOM_107]
I think I'm perennial!

[TREE_OF_WISDOM_108]
My xylem is tingling!

[TREE_OF_WISDOM_109]
You can get a lot of wisdom just by standing around.

[TREE_OF_WISDOM_110]
So I've heard about this "winter" dealie. Can't say I'm looking forward to it.

[TREE_OF_WISDOM_201]
Mmmm... sunlight is DELICIOUS!

[TREE_OF_WISDOM_202]
Oops, sorry... I just gave off some oxygen.

[TREE_OF_WISDOM_203]
Gosh, I can grow leaves!

[TREE_OF_WISDOM_204]
I feel a spurt coming on! 

[TREE_OF_WISDOM_205]
At this stage I lack worldly knowledge!

[TREE_OF_WISDOM_301]
I really appreciate all the cash you're spending on fertilizer!

[TREE_OF_WISDOM_302]
That cloud looks just like a vast aggregation of water droplets!

[TREE_OF_WISDOM_303]
Have you met my cousin Yggdrasil? Very big in Sweden. Lots of fans.

[TREE_OF_WISDOM_304]
I'm taking sociology at an online college. I'm really learning a lot.

[TREE_OF_WISDOM_305]
After careful observation I've deduced that it is the Earth that revolves around the sun and not the reverse as it appears.

[TREE_OF_WISDOM_401]
When you've been around as long as I have, you sleep less and hallucinate more.

[TREE_OF_WISDOM_402]
If you're mistaking the forest for the trees, just remember: A forest is a collection of individual trees and not the other way around.

[TREE_OF_WISDOM_403]
History repeats itself but it always gets the details wrong.

[TREE_OF_WISDOM_404]
If the past, present and future all simultaneously exist as "block time," surely the experience of "now" can only be an elaborate illusion?

[TREE_OF_WISDOM_405]
Courage is easy; dedication costs extra.

[TREE_OF_WISDOM_500]
Here's some wisdom that bears repeating...

[TREE_OF_WISDOM_600]
Tree food, please!

[TREE_OF_WISDOM_800]
Hey, I'm 100 feet tall! Celebrate with me by typing 'daisies' to get the zombies to leave tiny daisies behind when they die.

[TREE_OF_WISDOM_900]
Whoa! I'm 500 feet tall! This calls for some dancing! Type 'dance' to get the zombies to boogie on down!

[TREE_OF_WISDOM_1000]
WOW! I'm 1000 feet tall! Celebrate with me by typing 'pinata' to make zombies spit out candy when destroyed!

[TREE_OF_WISDOM_1100]
Thank you for feeding me! I've given you all my wisdom, but you can still grow me taller!

[LUME_SHROOM_TOOLTIP]
Removes boosts from zombies and produces sun

[LUME_SHROOM_DESCRIPTION]
Lume-shrooms take benefits from zombies and give you sun.
{EXTRASHORTLINE}
{KEYWORD}Range:{STAT} all zombies in a medium area
{KEYWORD}Special:{STAT} removes boosts from zombies, zombies killed around it produce sun
{NOCTURNAL}Sleeps during the day
{EXTRASHORTLINE}
{FLAVOR}"Plantern and I go way back," Lume-shroom says. "We have a bit of a friendly rivalry, Plantern gets jealous of the intense glow I make, although I try comforting him by telling him I can't maintain it for as long as he does."

[MORTAR_SHROOM_DESCRIPTION]
Mortar-shrooms deal heavy damage to zombies anywhere except around themselves.
{EXTRASHORTLINE}
{KEYWORD}Damage:{STAT} heavy
{KEYWORD}Range:{STAT} lobbed
{KEYWORD}Special:{STAT} can be planted on the roof
{NOCTURNAL}Sleeps during the day
{EXTRASHORTLINE}
{FLAVOR}Mortar-shroom has a 3-step plan to kill zombies: locate the target, calibrate coordinates, shoot. Although, he always seems to forget to account for wind. If only he hadn't slept through physics class. 

[LIGHTNING_REED_TOOLTIP]
Zaps several zombies and crows per strike

[LIGHTNING_REED_DESCRIPTION]
Lightning Reeds deal light electrical damage to multiple zombies and crows.
{SHORTLINE}
{KEYWORD}Damage:{STAT} low
{SHORTLINE}
{FLAVOR}Lightning Reed wasn't always the shocking star of the swamp, he started out as a humble glow stick for bog parties. One night, a freak thunderstorm and an energy drink changed everything. Now, he zaps with sizzling style. "Call it photosynthesis with flair," he says.

[HURRIKALE_TOOLTIP]
Blows a chilling wind that pushes back zombies in a lane

[HURRIKALE_DESCRIPTION]
Hurrikales blow a chilling wind that push back zombies in a lane.
{EXTRASHORTLINE}
{KEYWORD}Range:{STAT} all zombies in a lane
{KEYWORD}Usage:{STAT} single use, instant
{KEYWORD}Special:{STAT} pushes and chills zombies
{EXTRASHORTLINE}
{FLAVOR}Hurrikale always dreamed of being a soliloquist. "To blow, or not to blow, let's not pretend it was ever a question," he formulates. However, he can't be taken seriously as he's known for accidentally blowing away the scenario curtains whenever he gets too emotional.
